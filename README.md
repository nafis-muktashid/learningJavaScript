# learningJavaScript


*Working on this repo now*



I was following Jonas Schmedtmann's Udemy course videos. These are the codes that I've learned until now.


Most of the HTML and CSS files are taken from that course. only JavaScript files are developed by myself and copied for study purpose.


*****
With the part 2, 
    JavaScript Fundamentals comes to an end. The following folders, along with their contents will be a bit something more than fundamentals. 
*****
The art 3,
    is about some important developer skills that one good developer must have.
*****
The part 4,
    Contains simple DOM Manipulation with three small projects. 
*****
The part 5,
    is all about how JS works behind the scene.
